  <h2>The homepages I had made</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="htdocs/index-FW/index-FW.htm"<h3>Fireworks Version</h3> </a>    </li>
    <li> <a href="htdocs/html-DW.html"<h3>Dreamweaver Version</h3></a></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Discussion</h1>
  <h2>Using Fireworks</h2>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allows for easier customization because Fireworks is easier to use</li>
    <li>It is easier to create a wireframe in a quicker time </li>
    <li>There are more fonts to use, which can help with creation and making it look more visually appealing to the audience</li>
    <li>We can quickly include links using the slice tool</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Everything is an image, so editing it after publishing it is tedious</li>
    <li>Since everything is an image, you can't search it up because it displays as an image instead of text</li>
    <li>It's hard to edit all of the subpages at once</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using Dreamweaver</h2>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Things show up as text instead of showing up as an image, so it can easily be changed</li>
    <li>With a lot of different subpages, we can create a template so we can quickly edit all the subpages at once</li>
    <li>Using Dreamweaver instead of Fireworks allows for usage of CSS, which isn't available in Fireworks</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes the entire format of the page gets messed up if you move images and other objects</li>
    <li>Operating Dreamweaver is more difficult compared to using Fireworks</li>
  </ul>


<h1>Creating Templates</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is the template we created for our website</li>
<li>We decided to make my template's editable region in the center because I want my content to be focused on the middle of the page. It is also easier for the viewer to focus on the content</li>
<li>We decided to keep the siderbars and header for each page, this allows the viewer to be able to quickly browse between different subpages</li>

<h1>Review</h1>

<h1>MAP</h1>
<ul>
  <li>For the Community Service Club to be able to show the students of AIS what community service events are available</li>
  <li>For the students of AIS to be able to sign up for Community Service events on the internet instead of having to search for the signup sheet in school</li>
  <li>For the students of AIS to put up how many hours of Community Service they have</li>
  <li>For the students to understand more about the Community Service club</li>
</ul>
<h1>Original Objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Our original objective for this website was for the Community Service Club to be able to share their information about different Community Service events</li>
  <li>We also want them to be able to attract more people to sign up for Community Service</li>
  <li>We completed this by creating a sign up sheet, this will allow more people to sign up for Community Service events.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Feel and Message</h1>
<ul>
  <li>We want our website to not feel overly complicated. A simple design and a theme with just one main colour will allow the audience to focus on the main purpose of this website</li>
  <li>We want our website to be simple so that our audience can focus on filling out the information and obtaining information about Community Service</li>
  <li>Since our website is a page for signing up, we want the main focus of our website to be the signing up function.</li>
  <li>We want our smooth and easy website to lead people into signing up for different Community Service events. </li>
</ul>
<h1>Template</h1>

<img src="Community Service Template Screenshot.png"/>
<img src="Screenshot of Template.png"
<ul>
  <li>This is the original template I created for the group</li>
  <li>Although I created this template, our group decided to use a different template, because my template featured a sidebar that was too detailed</li>
  <li>My group thought that a pressable link for each different event was overkill and wasn't necessary, since there wasn't that much content for each different event</li>
  <li>We decided to get rid of my design, which featured a sidebar that showed all of the events.</li>
  <li>The second image is the template we decided to use as a group</li>
</ul>

<h1>Subpages</h1>
<ul>
  <li>These are the subpages our group created</li>
  <li>The subpages we have are:Abous Us, Service Sheets, Service Events, and Gallery(Pictures)</li>
  <li><a href="About page .html"> About Page </a></li>
</ul>
