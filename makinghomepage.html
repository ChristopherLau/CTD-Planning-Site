  <h2>The homepages I had made</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="htdocs/index-FW/index-FW.htm"<h3>Fireworks Version</h3> </a>    </li>
    <li> <a href="htdocs/html-DW.html"<h3>Dreamweaver Version</h3></a></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Discussion</h1>
  <h2>Using Fireworks</h2>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allows for easier customization because Fireworks is easier to use</li>
    <li>It is easier to create a wireframe in a quicker time </li>
    <li>There are more fonts to use, which can help with creation and making it look more visually appealing to the audience</li>
    <li>We can quickly include links using the slice tool</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Everything is an image, so editing it after publishing it is tedious</li>
    <li>Since everything is an image, you can't search it up because it displays as an image instead of text</li>
    <li>It's hard to edit all of the subpages at once</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Using Dreamweaver</h2>
  <h3>Pros</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Things show up as text instead of showing up as an image, so it can easily be changed</li>
    <li>With a lot of different subpages, we can create a template so we can quickly edit all the subpages at once</li>
    <li>Using Dreamweaver instead of Fireworks allows for usage of CSS, which isn't available in Fireworks</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Cons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sometimes the entire format of the page gets messed up if you move images and other objects</li>
    <li>Operating Dreamweaver is more difficult compared to using Fireworks</li>
  </ul>


<h1>Creating Templates</h1>
<ul>
<li>This is the template we created for our website</li>
<li>We decided to make my template's editable region in the center because I want my content to be focused on the middle of the page. It is also easier for the viewer to focus on the content</li>
<li>We decided to keep the siderbars and header for each page, this allows the viewer to be able to quickly browse between different subpages</li>
