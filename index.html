<h1>Final Project Idea</h1>
<ul>
  <li>After discussing with my new group members, we decided on creating a page for the Community Service Club</li>
  <li>The Community Service Club needs a website because there is not enough time for them to make announcements during Assembly</li>
  <li>Due to the insufficient amount of assemblies, there are many announcements that the Community Service Club is not able to make</li>
  <li>We want to create this website to help them solve this problem</li>
</ul>

<h1>Objectives and Purpose</h1>
 <ul>
   <li>We want to help the Community Service Club get their announcements across</h1>
   <li>We want to create a platform in which the Community Service Club can tell the school about their future projects and community service events</li>
   <li>On this website, we can allow members of the Community Service club to post announcements and for the members of the school community to view them<li>
   <li>Another problem the Community Service has is that people are not approaching the members of the club for events, instead the club members have to approach individuals in order to get them to participate in events.</li>
   <li>If possible, we can program a signup sheet for interested people to sign up for events.</li>
 </ul>
